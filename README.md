# Bernstein-Dispersion-Relations
This Python script evaluates the roots of Bernstein waves in a multi-species plasma. Three different methods are provided: A root-finding method based on Newton-Raphon's method, a closed form of $k(\omega)$ using an estimative dispersion relation, and an eigen-value problem formulation.
