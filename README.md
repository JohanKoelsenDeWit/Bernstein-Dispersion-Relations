# Bernstein-Dispersion-Relations
These Python scripts evaluate the roots of electron and ion Bernstein waves in a multi-species plasma. Three different methods are provided: A root-finding method based on Newton-Raphon's method; a direct evaluation from a closed form of $k(\omega)$ using an estimative expression, suitable for the fundamental dispersion branch; an eigenvalue problem formulation.
